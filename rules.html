A Stationary Yellow Flag will be displayed during the formation lap. All karts should proceed to their grid position and form up for the start of the race. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     All flags are used at the discretion of Race Officials, the starter, and corner workers. Decisions related to Black Flags can not be protested, all Race Official decisions are final.
