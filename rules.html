When the unsafe condition has been cleared, karts will be permitted to restart, will be re-aligned and started. Karts will have the same 90-second rule as if they were on the grid.</span></p>
							<p class="c0 subtitle"><span class="c6">Option 2:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;All karts will be removed from the track and quarantined in a secure area, until such time the Race Director chooses to restart the group. At this time karts will be permitted to restart, will be re-aligned and started. Karts will have the same 90-second rule as if they were on the grid.</span></p>
							<p class="c0 subtitle"><span class="c2">All karts involved in an incident that requires a Red Flag, will require a safety check by the Head Technical Inspector, or their designee before being allowed to return to the track.</span></p>
